The attribute \ value\ is deprecated. Refer to the provider documentation for details. In version 2.0 of the AzureAD provider, this attribute will become read-only as it will no longer be possible to specify a password value. 
It will be generated by Azure Active Directory and persisted to state for reuse in your Terraform configuration. ERR trap fired!
